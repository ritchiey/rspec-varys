*Everything should be built top-down, except the first time - Alan
Perlis*

RSpec-Varys automatically generates RSpec specs from your mocked methods each time your suite is run.

This enables you to build your program from the top-down (or outside-in if
your prefer) without having to manually keep track of which mocks have
been validated.

So with Varys automatically generating new specs, your BDD workflow
might look something like:

  1. Write top-level spec and run it
  2. Write top-level code
  2. Mock top-level spec to make it pass
  3. Paste in specs generated by Varys and run them
  4. Mock generated specs until the pass
  5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until
