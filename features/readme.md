*Everything should be built top-down, except the first time - Alan
Perlis*

RSpec-Varys automatically generates RSpec specs from your mocked methods each time your suite is run.

This enables you to build your program from the top-down (or outside-in if
your prefer) without having to manually keep track of which mocks have
been validated.
