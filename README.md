# RSpec Varys

Generate RSpec specs from intelligence gathered from doubles and spies.

This is an experiment to see if a top-down TDD work-flow can be improved by partially automating the creation of lower level specs.

See the [Cucumber features](https://relishapp.com/spechero/rspec-varys/docs) for examples of intended usage.
