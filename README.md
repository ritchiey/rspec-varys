# Rspec::Varys

Generate RSpec specs from intelligence gathered from doubles and spies.

This is an experiment to see if a top-down TDD work-flow can be improved by partially automating the creation of lower level specs.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rspec-varys'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rspec-varys
